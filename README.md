Customer Segmentation using K-Means Clustering
Project Overview
This project focuses on customer segmentation using the K-Means clustering algorithm. Customer segmentation is a marketing strategy that involves dividing customers into groups based on common characteristics so companies can market to each group effectively and appropriately.

In this project, I applied K-Means to a dataset containing customer details to identify distinct groups within the customer base. These segments can then be targeted individually, helping businesses personalize their marketing strategies, improve customer satisfaction, and increase revenue.

Key Steps:
Data Cleaning and Preprocessing: Handled missing values, outliers, and normalized the dataset for better clustering performance.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualized key features to understand data distribution and customer behavior.

Choosing the Optimal Number of Clusters: Used the Elbow Method and Silhouette Analysis to determine the best number of clusters.

Modeling with K-Means: Built the K-Means model and interpreted the resulting clusters.

Visualization: Used scatter plots and other visual techniques to represent different customer segments clearly.

Technologies Used:
Python

Google Colab

Pandas, NumPy

Scikit-learn

Matplotlib, Seaborn
